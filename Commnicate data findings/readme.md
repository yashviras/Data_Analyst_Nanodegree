Comunicate Data findings with Ford Bike data
By Yash Viras

## Dataset

In this project, I am going to perform exploratory data analysis on fordgo bike dataset.
Variables including, trip duration, start time and end time with date, start station
and end station names, start and end coordinates, customer type, year of birth and gender.


## Summary of Findings

- Customers' rides seems increasing slightly but subscibers' rides reached 6 times more 
than customers' on October 2018. There is a decrease on November 2018 for subscribers 
but it seems like it is related with winter season.
- Subscribers' average trip duration is around 11 minutes. Customers' average trip duration
 is around 28 minutes.
- Subscribers and customers trip distance were about the same, which is slightly more than 
one mile.
- 90% of bike rides take place on weekday.
- The peak bike rides time for all members is around commute time.
- There were 3.31 billion rides.
- 8am and 5pm are the peak hours for this service. Also, people use this service when they are 
in lunch time as well.
- Percentage of subscribers is almost %88.15. Percentage of customers is almost %11.85.
- Finally, After Ford GoBike did a pilot launch of e-bike on April 24th 2018, there have been 
quite a lot of electric bike rides as well, which reached to 10% of daily rides at the end of 
July 2018. However, daily electric bike rides is on downward trend.


## Key Insights for Presentation

There are less bikers on Saturday and on Sundays on average. There are more younger 
bikers (age < 40) across 7 days and 24 hours.Female bikers bike longer on average compared 
to male bikers. 'Customer' bikers bike longer on average compared to 'Subscriber' bikers. 
The bikers are the least in 3:00 AM and 4:00 AM.

Subscribers are primarily daily commuters, having short trips to and from work, who 
rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm, and, occasionally around lunch time. 
Customers are usually tourists or occassional riders who use the system mainly on weekends 
to explore the Bay Area.
